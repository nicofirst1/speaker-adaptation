People engaged in a conversation may have varying levels of knowledge about a particular topic. When this is the case, speakers need to be able adapt their utterances by taking their interlocutors into account to achieve communicative success. Human speakers can adapt on the fly presumably thanks to our Theory of Mind capabilities, which
%When people with varying semantic knowledge have a conversation, they may only be able to communicate successfully by adapting their utterances on the fly to better align with their interlocutors. This is possible presumably due to our Theory of Mind capabilities, which 
enable us to consider our interlocutors' levels of comprehension and knowledge. In this paper, we model an adaptive speaker playing an asymmetric referential game with listeners that lack visual and linguistic information about certain domains. Inspired by the plug-and-play approach to controlled language generation, our speaker includes a Theory of Mind module that simulates the listener and steers the adaptation of referring utterances on the fly, without any additional training of the underlying language model. Our experiments and analyses show that this approach to adaptation is effective in asymmetric communicative setups. \san{of course here we may want to say a little more but we can't really do it now}


% When people with varying visual or linguistic capabilities have a conversation, they are able to communicate successfully by adapting their utterances on-the-fly to better align with their interlocutors. This is presumably possible due to our Theory of Mind capabilities that enable us to consider our interlocutors' levels of comprehension and knowledge. In this paper, inspired by the plug-and-play approach to language model adaptation, we propose a pipeline for speaker adaptation with the aim of improving communicative success in a referential game. We use data extracted from a dataset of multimodal dialogues to train a speaker and domain-specific listeners. We exploit external listener behavior to train the speaker's Theory of Mind module simulating listeners' behavior from the perspective of the speaker. We observe that, with the help of this simulator, the speaker is able to yield referring utterances that are tailored more towards its audience that might lack linguistic and visual information on out-of-domain concepts.

% Agents exposed to different visual or linguistic domains may have varying proficiency across domains. When referring to visual content coming from a certain domain, we might adapt the way we describe them in line with our impression of our interlocutors' levels of comprehension in that domain. 



% \note{start with the general problem we tackle: speakers do not have the same experiences/knowledge, yet we are able to communicate by adapting on the fly in conversation ... presumably this is due to our ToM capability... In this paper we investigate this issues in the context of a referential task...  }

% Agents exposed to different visual or linguistic domains may have varying proficiency across domains. When referring to visual content coming from a certain domain, we might adapt the way we describe them in line with our impression of our interlocutors' levels of comprehension in that domain. In our work, inspired by the plug-and-play approach to language model adaptation, we propose models of speaker adaptation to listener domains with the aim of improving listeners' comprehension and task success.

%  We use a dataset of multimodal dialogues to train domain-specific listeners and an all-knowing speaker. We then provide the speaker with the ability to adapt to listeners, simulating their behavior. Since a speaker would not have direct access to the internal states of their interlocutors, we exploit listener behavior to train the speaker's theory of mind module. In this way, the speaker is able to simulate the listeners and modify its outputs to obtain referring utterances tailored more to a listener that might lack information on out-domain concepts (linguistic and visual) ...

\section*{Limitations}
EMNLP 2022 requires all submissions to have a section titled ``Limitations'', for discussing the limitations of the paper as a complement to the discussion of strengths in the main text. This section should occur after the conclusion, but before the references. It will not count towards the page limit.  

The discussion of limitations is mandatory. Papers without a limitation section will be desk-rejected without review.
ARR-reviewed papers that did not include ``Limitations'' section in their prior submission, should submit a PDF with such a section together with their EMNLP 2022 submission.

While we are open to different types of limitations, just mentioning that a set of results have been shown for English only probably does not reflect what we expect. 
Mentioning that the method works mostly for languages with limited morphology, like English, is a much better alternative.
In addition, limitations such as low scalability to long text, the requirement of large GPU resources, or other things that inspire crucial further investigation are welcome.

\section*{Ethics Statement}
Scientific work published at EMNLP 2022 must comply with the \href{https://www.aclweb.org/portal/content/acl-code-ethics}{ACL Ethics Policy}. We encourage all authors to include an explicit ethics statement on the broader impact of the work, or other ethical considerations after the conclusion but before the references. The ethics statement will not count toward the page limit (8 pages for long, 4 pages for short papers).
